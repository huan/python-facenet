Welcome to a tutorial series, covering OpenCV, which is an image and video processing library with bindings in C++, C, Python, and Java. OpenCV is used for all sorts of image and video analysis, like facial recognition and detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic vision, optical character recognition, and a whole lot more.

We will be working through many Python examples here. Getting started with OpenCV's Python bindings is actually much easier than many people make it out to be initially. You will need two main libraries, with an optional third: python-OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
